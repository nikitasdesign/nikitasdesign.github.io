      <h1>Intro</h1>
</div>
      <p>The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to impose strict curfew rules on their citizens. This led to considerable stress and psychological strain for a large part of the population. Adapting to new routines and finding inner balance is key to good mental health in this situation. The organisation Mental Health Europe is looking for a solution that could help people in need. </p>

  <h1>Empathize & Define</h1>
  <p>To get a better understanding of the users, we developed our persona "Ella" on whose needs and pain points the app is based.</p>

<div class="persona">

<div class="person">

<img id="ella" src="image/ella.png" alt="Persona">
  <h2 id="ellas">Ella Castelli, 23</h2>
</div>

<div class="person hobbies">
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>Not so much. Actually meeting friends but that has fallen away due to the Corona Lockdowns and many of her friendships have lost their way. She often feels very alone.</p>
</div>

<div class="person goals">
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>Ella wants to finish her bachelor thesis as soon as possible in order to have more time for herself and to build up closer contact with friends again. Due to the lockdown and isolation, she has changed and become more negative than before. Her goal is to rediscover the old Ella, who has fun and joy and radiates with positivity.</p>
</div>

<div class="person painpoints">
  <h2>Pain points</h2>
  <p>She is very stressed by her bachelor thesis. It is difficult for her to make certain plans and stick to them. Because she currently sits at her desk for most of the day and writes her BA, she is often frustrated by the same daily routine at the end of the day and often only sees the negative aspects.  Ella finds time management very difficult. She almost never takes time for herself and hardly ever gets any rest.</p>

  <h3>Information architecture</h3>
  <img id="infoa" class="infopic" src="image/informationarchitecture.png" alt="Information architecture">
  <p>After some research and brainstorming, we decided on the theme of water, sea, ocean.
  From a psychological point of view, water is considered very calming due to the even up and down movements, as are the meditative swimming movements of the fish.
  Since the app is supposed to convey mindfulness, positivity and balance to the user, the water theme seemed like a strong metaphor.</p>

<div class="prototyping">

  <h1>Prototyping & User testing</h1>
  <p>Using the "crazy 8s" method, each team member scribbled a selection of 8 frames.
This worked very well, as many different ideas came up in a relatively short time. We were able to derive our core functions from the scribbled ideas.</p>
<h3>Paper prototype</h3>

<div class="wrapper">

<div class="item">

</div>

<div class="item">
  <img id="paperprototype" src="image/paper/paper6.png" alt="Paper Prototype">
</div>

</div>

<p>With the paper prototype, which we photographed and made clickable, we conducted user tests. We chose the method of "think out loud", in which the user is given tasks and is supposed to say all thoughts about the product out loud. We conducted the tests with about 7 people and optimised the scribbles in the next step, the wireframing, based on the criticism and feedback.</p>

<div class="specify">
  <h1>Specify the design</h1>
  <p>In order to create a uniform design as a team, we developed a design system. We were inspired by the ocean and created our own illustrations.
To make the user experience even more enjoyable, we opted for onboarding with a personal tour of the app by a diver.

<div class="learnings">
  <h1>What I've learned</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>As this was my first big project in a team, I learned a lot about communication and time management</li>
    <li>Also it was the first time i tried to make little animations to make the prototype alive</li>
    <li>Next time I would take more time to define the design system. In the process we changed the design system multiple times, I think if we took more time in the beginning to plan everything properly, we would have worked faster and cleaner</li>
    <li>Also I would plan time to make user tests with the final product. We only made user tests with the paper  prototype and didn’t test the new functions of the final product. Also we didn’t receive much new feedack from the users. Next time I would not only choose the “think out loud” method for the tests, I would also prepare interview questions and interview a bigger age range of users.</li>
  </ul>
